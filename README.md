I have created a Personal Portfolio using HTML and CSS styling sheets only.
This shows you a brief description about myself and what i do in respect to being a front end developer. The site also has a About me section where i give a breif intro to myself, a Work section where i show some of the projects i have worked on and finally a contact me section where you can contact me via Github, email and various other methods.

## Description

I have created this project to showcase my programming skills using HTML and CSS. The site is also responsive and has the ability to be displayed on smaller/larger screen sizes. this project shows how CSS classes work, e.g The grid method, and how grid items work. Also i have used Flex box as i wanted to use both as i have been learning both.  

## User Acceptance Criteria

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
