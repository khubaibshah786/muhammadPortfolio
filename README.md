I have created this project to showcase my programming skills using HTML and CSS. The site is also responsive and has the ability to be displayed on smaller/larger screen sizes. this project shows how CSS classes work, e.g The grid method, and how grid items work. Also i have used Flex box as i wanted to use both as i have been learning both.
